        ## Provided JavaScript code

        ## Validation Steps to Perform
        For each finding, answer these 3 key questions:
        
        1. **Existence**: Does this issue actually exist in the code?
        - Verify the code line numbers and snippets are accurate
        - Confirm it can be actually observed in the provided code
        
        2. **Exploitability**: Can this issue be actually exploited?
        - Logically analyze if the provided PoC would work
        - Review if a real attack scenario is possible
        - Assess attack difficulty and any prerequisites
        
        3. **Severity Accuracy**: Is the assigned severity appropriate?
        - Evaluate based on actual security impact based on CVSS v4.0 Ratings
        - Adjust overestimated or underestimated severity
        
        ## Instructions You Must Follow
        1. Exclude all items confirmed to be false positives.
        2. Correct any findings that are partially accurate with the right information.
        3. Adjust severity ratings that are incorrectly assessed.
        4. Base your validation results on code and security expertise.
        5. Write a concise reason for each validated item in the exploitation_scenario field.
